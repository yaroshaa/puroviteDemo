                <p>There are many benefits to choosing a capsule over other delivery forms for your supplements.
                    Capsules allow for rapid delivery of your supplement without any unpleasant tastes (off-putting
                    bitterness, for instance) that some individual ingredients have. They also provide more effective

                            customers will experience by choosing your formulation. Effective packaging makes a big
                            impact. It catches attention, guides your product to their cart, and leaves them feeling

                        <p>Your product's packaging is important for more than just marketing purposes. Your label

                            range of packaging to fit your needs:</p><br>

                        <p>CAPSULES are an excellent choice for those looking for a 100% vegetarian option that works
                            just as well as a gelatin-based capsule. These come in two types:<br>
                            Hypromellose/Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC): The shell is made entirely of water and
                            HPMC, without any animal by-products, BSE, GMOs, or gelatin. It is also gluten- and
                            starch-free.
                            Pullulan: This water-soluble polysaccharide is produced by the fermentation of sugar and
                            starch using the fungus Aerobasidum pullulans. It is similar to the
                            HPMC capsule but 100% natural.</p><br>
